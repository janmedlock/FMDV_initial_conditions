* Finish merging 'fixed_point' branch and delete
  I think the difference is now just the appendix in [[file:notes/notes.tex]]

* [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_method#Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_for_nonlinear_problems][Try the fixed-point solver]]

** Consider adding the alpha parameter so that
   phi_{i+1} = alpha * phi_i + (1 - alpha) f(phi_i)

* Consider log transforming in all solvers

* What about dropping the E state?

* What about making $a$ and $z$ finite and working with b.c.?

* There are TODOs to try to get the solvers working in
  [[file:models/_model/_poincare.py]] and [[file:miscellany/model_birth_ppl.py]].

* Unstructured model
  * Finding limit cycles doesn't working for the piecewise-linear
    birth rate

* Time-since-infection-structured model
  * Limit-cycle solver doesn't work for SAT2 & SAT3

* Age-structured model
  * Find equiblibrium eigenvalues
  * Find limit-cycle exponents

* Combination model
  * Test solver
  * Change parameters so that I can solve with larger time steps
    * It will take around a week to solve for 10 years at t_step=0.001

* Bootstrap equilibria & limit cycles from simpler models
  * Equilibria
    * time-since-infection & age -> combination
  * Limit cycles

* Make Solvers inherit from each other
  * Move '_Hq()', '_Fq()', '_Tq()', '_B', etc into _model.solver.Solver()

* Can I find a limit-cycle of say period 6 then see if it is actually
  period 1, 2, or 3?

* Joel Miller suggested using survivals for the compartments with time
  since entry. I don't see that this helps because now you can no
  longer find x^{\ell} from just x^{\ell - 1} but need all the
  previous x and the initial condition.
