* CSC arrays
  * Solving the age-structured population model is about twice as slow
    with CSC as with CSR.
  * Solving for the fundamental solution of the
    time-since-entry-structured model takes 2.6% less time with CSC.
  * Check timing with the age-structured model.
    * get_eigenvalues() takes forever...
      * Try converting each matrix to CSC

* Age-structured model
  * Find equiblibrium eigenvalues
  * Find limit cycle
    * Not quite a limit cycle: run solution for longer first?
  * Find limit-cycle exponents
  * Try bsr_array(blocksize=(J, J))?

* Combination model
  * Write numerical method as linear algebra
    * Kronecker product: `\otimes`, `numpy.kron()`
  * Write models.combination._solver.Solver

* Shifting the eigenvalues does not find the right ones

* Can I bootstrap up equilibria & limit cycles from simpler models?

* Profile initializing solvers, solving, finding equilibria, etc.

* Make Solvers inherit from each other
  * Move '_Hq()', '_Fq()', '_Tq()', '_B', etc into _model.solver.Solver()

* Can I find a limit-cycle of say period 6 then see if it is actually
  period 1, 2, or 3?
