* Age-structured model
  * Find equiblibrium eigenvalues
  * Find limit-cycle exponents
  * Try bsr_array(blocksize=(J, J))?

* Combination model
  * Test solver
  * Change parameters so that I can solve with larger time steps

* Bootstrap up equilibria & limit cycles from simpler models

* Make Solvers inherit from each other
  * Move '_Hq()', '_Fq()', '_Tq()', '_B', etc into _model.solver.Solver()

* Can I find a limit-cycle of say period 6 then see if it is actually
  period 1, 2, or 3?
