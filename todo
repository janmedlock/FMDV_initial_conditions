* Why is scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve() in _fundamental.solver.step()
  MUCH slower for the time-since-entry-structured model with CSC
  arrays than with CSR? I expect it to be faster because it is
  skipping converting CSR to CSC, which seems to slow down the same
  spsolve() for the age-structured model.

* Age-structured model
  * Find equiblibrium eigenvalues
  * Find limit cycle
    * Not quite a limit cycle: run solution for longer first?
  * Find limit-cycle exponents

* Combination model
  * Write numerical method as linear algebra
    * Kronecker product: `\otimes`, `numpy.kron()`
  * Write models.combination._solver.Solver

* Shifting the eigenvalues does not find the right ones

* Can I bootstrap up equilibria & limit cycles from simpler models?

* Profile initializing solvers, solving, finding equilibria, etc.

* Make Solvers inherit from each other
  * Move '_Hq()', '_Fq()', '_Tq()', '_B', etc into _model.solver.Solver()

* Can I find a limit-cycle of say period 6 then see if it is actually
  period 1, 2, or 3?
