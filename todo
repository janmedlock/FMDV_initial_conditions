* Is mmap useful?

* Understand eigenvalue shift

* Age-structured model
  * Find equiblibrium eigenvalues
  * Find limit cycle
    * Not quite a limit cycle: run solution for longer first?
  * Find limit-cycle exponents
  * Try bsr_array(blocksize=(J, J))?

* Combination model
  * Write numerical method as linear algebra
    * Kronecker product: `\otimes`, `numpy.kron()`
  * Write models.combination._solver.Solver

* Do I get the Jacobian or monodromy from root()?

* Can I bootstrap up equilibria & limit cycles from simpler models?

* Profile initializing solvers, solving, finding equilibria, etc.

* Make Solvers inherit from each other
  * Move '_Hq()', '_Fq()', '_Tq()', '_B', etc into _model.solver.Solver()

* Can I find a limit-cycle of say period 6 then see if it is actually
  period 1, 2, or 3?
