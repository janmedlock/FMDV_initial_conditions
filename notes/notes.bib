  abstract =     {Extremely contagious pathogens are a global biosecurity
                  threat because of their high burden of morbidity and
                  mortality, and their capacity for fast-moving
                  epidemics that are difficult to quell. Understanding
                  the mechanisms enabling persistence of highly
                  transmissible pathogens in their host populations is
                  thus a central problem in disease ecology. Combining
                  experimental and theoretical approaches, we
                  investigated how highly contagious foot-and-mouth
                  disease viruses persist in their wildlife reservoir,
                  African buffalo.  We found that viral persistence
                  via transmission among acutely infected hosts alone
                  is unlikely.  However, including even very
                  occasional transmission from persistently infected
                  carriers reliably rescues the most infectious viral
                  strain from fade-out. Additional mechanisms, such as
                  antigenic shift, loss of immunity, or spillover
                  among host populations, may be required for
                  persistence of less transmissible strains.},
